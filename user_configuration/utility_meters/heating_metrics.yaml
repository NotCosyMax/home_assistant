  # General Information about the Utility Meters in this file:
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The prefix "UM: " for names ("um_" for unique ids) means "Utility Meter". 
  #
  # While the "prefix" creates somewhat messy initial names for the entities, it makes 
  # it easy to filter on utility meters. This is extra helpful if you for example have a 
  # long-term recorder setup, but only want to store away entities that you find meaningful 
  # to store.
  #
  # The expectation is that unless explicitiy marked "UPDATE TO YOUR ENTITY" or "UPDATE", one 
  # should not need to alter anything in the templates to get them to a working state.

  # Utility Meters to track energy consumption of heating system (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and total).
  # These are similar to the statistics in the Energy Panel, but provides actual sensors with 
  # values that can be processed and recorded by other parts of HA.
